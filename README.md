REST Describe & Compile
=======================

This project's goal is to implement a compiler for meta descriptions of REST APIs. Currently the meta description language is Marc Hadley's [WADL](https://wadl.dev.java.net/). The compiler should be capable to automatically create client libraries in various programming languages based on the API meta description. It should be embedded into a Rich Web Application implemented with the Google Web Toolkit. A [live demo version](http://tomayac.com/rest-describe/latest/RestDescribe.html) of the application is available online. You can also view the [screencasts on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tomayac+%22rest+describe+%26+compile%22).
